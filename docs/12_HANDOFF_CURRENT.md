# Current Handoff

## Task
First Vertical Slice

## Status
FVS-02 PERSISTENCE / REPOSITORY / MIGRATION — COMPLETE; READY_FOR_CODEX_ACCEPTANCE

Acceptance repair log: `docs/27_ACCEPTANCE_REPAIR_LOG.md`

## Active Writer
OpenCode — persistence implementation (FVS-02 DONE, awaiting Codex acceptance)

## Starting Branch
feature/first-vertical-slice

## Goal
Deliver the first real PolyNexus end-to-end product path:

Project
→ Review Task
→ ContextPackage
→ WorkflowDefinition
→ Reference/Mock Runtime
→ Run Supervisor
→ Finding + Evidence
→ Persist
→ Result
→ Reload History

## Confirmed Baseline
- ADR-001 through ADR-010 frozen.
- Windows development environment accepted.
- OpenCode onboarding PASS.
- Codex onboarding PASS.
- Antigravity onboarding PASS.
- Git backup available at D:\GitBackup\PolyNexus_Backup.git.

## Tool Assignment

### Codex
First writer:
- domain boundaries
- run supervisor
- workflow execution contracts
- evidence/context/artifact integration boundaries

### OpenCode
Second writer:
- persistence implementation
- API wiring
- tests
- routine integration work

### Antigravity
Milestone verifier:
- UI/E2E only after vertical slice becomes runnable

## FVS-01 Update

### Goal
Implement the minimum Domain / Execution Skeleton for Project, Task, Run, Artifact, ContextPackage, Evidence, Finding, normalized Run lifecycle, Runtime Adapter boundary, and Workflow execution boundary.

### Changed files
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/domain/enums.py`
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/domain/models.py`
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/runtime/contracts.py`
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/runtime/reference.py`
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/runtime/supervisor.py`
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/workflows/models.py`
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/workflows/execution.py`
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/workflows/loader.py`
- `services/core/tests/test_domain_models.py`
- `services/core/tests/test_runtime_skeleton.py`
- `services/core/tests/test_workflow_loader.py`

### Implemented
- Stdlib-only Domain dataclasses with stable IDs and structured ContextPackage references.
- Reference in-memory RuntimeAdapter only; no Codex/OpenCode runtime integration.
- Core-owned RunSupervisor with normalized start/collect/cancel lifecycle and cleanup verification.
- Canonical WorkflowDefinition normalization while preserving existing raw loader behavior.
- Explicit RUNTIME_EVIDENCE separation from AI_OPINION and tests for evidence/status values.

### Tests and validation
- `git diff --check`: PASS, exit code 0.
- `services/core/tests/test_domain_models.py`, `test_runtime_skeleton.py`, `test_workflow_loader.py` via `.venv` pytest: blocked by Unicode workspace process launch, exit code 1.
- `scripts/test_core.ps1`: blocked when launching `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, exit code 101.
- `scripts/preflight.ps1`: baseline validator launch blocked by the same issue; wrapper exit code 1, inner Python launch exit code 101.

### Known blocker
The existing `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` cannot be launched from the current Codex Desktop sandbox because the workspace path contains Chinese characters and the process launcher converts it to `????`. No dependency or environment setting was changed. Current pytest and baseline validation results remain UNVERIFIED.

### Next
Rerun `scripts/test_core.ps1` and `scripts/preflight.ps1` from an environment that can launch the existing project Python runtime. After deterministic validation passes, continue with WP-02 persistence/repository work.

## FVS-02 Update

### Goal
Persistence / Repository / Migration — make FVS-01 Domain / Execution Skeleton durable and reloadable.

### Changed files
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/persistence/__init__.py` (new)
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/persistence/database.py` (new)
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/persistence/models.py` (new)
- `services/core/src/polynexus_core/persistence/repository.py` (new, modified in repair)
- `services/core/alembic.ini` (new)
- `services/core/alembic/env.py` (new)
- `services/core/alembic/script.py.mako` (new)
- `services/core/alembic/versions/0001_initial_schema.py` (new)
- `services/core/tests/test_persistence.py` (new, modified in repair)

### Implemented
- SQLAlchemy ORM models mapping Domain dataclasses to SQLite tables (metadata/state/index only per ADR-008).
- Repository interfaces (ABC) for Project, Task, ContextPackage, Run, RunEvent, Artifact, Finding, Evidence.
- SQLite repository implementations with Domain↔ORM conversion boundary.
- `SqlRunEventRepository` concrete implementation with `add()` and `list_by_run()`.
- `SqlRunRepository.list_by_task()` now hydrates RunEvent history for each returned Run.
- Timestamp contract: `_ensure_utc_naive()` normalizes timezone-aware UTC datetimes to naive UTC at the write boundary; read returns naive UTC as-is.
- Alembic initial migration (0001_initial_schema) with 8 tables: projects, tasks, context_packages, runs, run_events, artifacts, findings, evidence.
- JSON serialization for tuple/list fields (instructions, constraints, artifact_refs, evidence_refs, etc.).
- ContextPackage reference-based persistence (no artifact content in SQLite).
- Artifact SHA-256 identity field preserved.
- Run lifecycle state + events + result persistence.
- Full history reload from reopened database.
- Real Alembic lifecycle test: upgrade head → verify → downgrade base → verify → upgrade head → reopen/reload.

### DB schema summary
8 tables: `projects`, `tasks`, `context_packages`, `runs`, `run_events`, `artifacts`, `findings`, `evidence`. All string IDs, datetime fields, JSON-serialized tuple/list fields. No artifact content stored in SQLite.

### Repository boundaries
- Domain dataclasses remain stdlib-only; no SQLAlchemy/FastAPI dependency.
- All persistence goes through Repository ABC interfaces.
- ORM models are internal to `persistence` package only.
- No raw SQL in application code.

### Tests and validation (FVS-02 FINAL — 2026-08-18T22:45:00+08:00)
- `services/core/tests/test_persistence.py`: 38 tests — PASS, exit code 0.
- Full `services/core` pytest: 51 tests — PASS, exit code 0.
- `git diff --check`: PASS, exit code 0.
- Execution environment: temp venv `C:\temp_pn_venv2\Scripts\python.exe` (Python 3.13.14).
- FVS02-AC-001 BLOCKER (Unicode workspace path) remains — environment issue, not product issue.

### Codex acceptance findings (all resolved in `FVS02-AC-002` repair)
- ~~MAJOR: `RunEventRepository` has an ABC but no concrete `SqlRunEventRepository`; list-based Run history does not hydrate events.~~ FIXED.
- ~~MAJOR: timezone-aware Domain timestamps use timezone-unspecified persistence columns; round-trip preservation needs an explicit contract and tests.~~ FIXED.
- ~~MINOR: persistence migration tests use `Base.metadata.create_all()` rather than the Alembic upgrade/downgrade lifecycle.~~ FIXED.

### Test count
- New persistence tests: 38
- Total project tests: 51

### ADR impact
None. ADR-008 fully respected: SQLite stores metadata/state/index only; artifact content boundary preserved; ContextPackage uses reference-based persistence.

### Scope deviation
None. All work within FVS-02 scope (WP-02).

### Next
- **Codex**: Rerun independent acceptance verification. Do not mark PASS from historical logs.
- **Codex**: Verify all 51 tests pass with current deterministic evidence.
- **Codex**: Verify `docs/27_ACCEPTANCE_REPAIR_LOG.md` findings FVS02-AC-002, FVS02-AC-003, FVS02-AC-004 are resolved.
- After Codex acceptance: proceed with WP-03 (API wiring) or WP-04 (integration).

## Restrictions
- Do not change ADR-001–010 without a new ADR and explicit human approval.
- Do not add Plugin/MCP infrastructure.
- Do not add unrelated V1 features.
- Do not allow multiple active writers.
- Do not claim PASS without current deterministic evidence.
